# Connectivity

## Why Connectivity

* Fragmentation is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss
* It diminishes genetic diversity

# Continuous connectivity measures

# Graph based connectivity measures

## How does it work

* We generate a network of patches
* Each patch has attributes (Size, Diversity, Land use, etc)
* Each edge has attributes (Distance, conductivity/resistance)

## Pros and cons

**Pros**

* Computationally eficient
* Robust mathematical framework

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
* Generating the dataset as a network might not be as easy
